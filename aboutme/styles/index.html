    <h2>Nickname - Dhelah</h2>
    <p>I'm from Ghana and currently I work as a teacher full time and as a graphic designer part-time. 
        I basically like anything that has to do with design that's why i chose the course in the first place.
        I am very enthusiastic about this course and can't wait to connect with all of you. 
        I am single. I enjoy reading, music and food. </p>
    <p>I am currently not a member of the church but like the efforts the church is making 
        to reach out to people all over the world in terms of education.</p>
    <p> Thank you.</p>
